# Update - 2018
This version is deprecated. I will upload a new version of my dotfiles soon.

# dotfiles
My Dotfiles - As a [Homeshick](https://github.com/andsens/homeshick) castle. 
Includes the Ultimate `vim` configuration (https://github.com/amix/vimrc) and [Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto).

I also customized the giddy prompt to make my own [custom Prezto prompt] (https://github.com/ngphadke/dotfiles/blob/master/home/.zprezto/modules/prompt/functions/prompt_nphadke_setup)
